I have developed a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes, when their characteristics are specified with CART algorithm.
I implemented CART algorithm in Python and derive SQL, Excel, or Python codes.
In this way, when a new record falls into the database, we can make predictions without leaving the database.
We are able to present that prediction to the user again through the database application.


Decision trees have influenced a wide field of machine learning, encompassing both classification and regression problems.

The purpose of the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm is to transform the complex structures in the data set into simple decision structures.
Heterogeneous data sets are divided into homogeneous subgroups according to a specified target variable.
